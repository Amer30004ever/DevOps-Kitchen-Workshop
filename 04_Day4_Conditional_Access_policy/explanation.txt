Here’s a step-by-step explanation of each setup (Ahmed, Mahmoud, and Mostafa) and the reasoning behind the use of every resource or data block:

---

### **Ahmed: Internal User with Full S3 Access**
- **Requirement**: Ahmed needs full administrator access to S3 for internal operations.
- **Solution**: Use the AWS-managed policy `AmazonS3FullAccess`.

#### **Explanation of Resources**
1. **`aws_iam_user_policy_attachment`**:
   - Attaches the managed policy `AmazonS3FullAccess` to Ahmed.
   - **Why?** Since AWS provides a pre-configured policy that grants full access to S3, there’s no need to create a custom policy. This simplifies the setup and maintenance.

---

### **Mahmoud: External User with IP-Restricted S3 Access**
- **Requirement**: Mahmoud, an external user, needs to read objects from the S3 bucket, but only from his company’s public IP (`41.45.34.102`).

#### **Explanation of Resources**
1. **`aws_iam_role`**:
   - Creates a role Mahmoud can assume to access S3.
   - **Why?** Since Mahmoud is external, granting direct access to S3 is not ideal. By using a role, you can enforce security boundaries and restrict access through the `sts:AssumeRole` API.

2. **`data.aws_iam_policy_document`**:
   - Defines a custom policy that allows `s3:GetObject` actions on specific bucket resources, but only if the request originates from Mahmoud’s company IP.
   - **Why?** The IP restriction ensures access control, making it safer to grant Mahmoud access to the bucket.

3. **`aws_iam_policy`**:
   - Converts the policy document from the `data` block into a reusable IAM policy.
   - **Why?** AWS requires policies to be in a specific format (JSON) when attaching them to roles or users.

4. **`aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`**:
   - Attaches the custom policy to Mahmoud’s role.
   - **Why?** This ensures that the policy applies when Mahmoud assumes the role.

### **Mostafa: Internal User with GetObject Access**
- **Requirement**: Mostafa and his team need access to fetch files from the S3 bucket, without any IP restrictions.

#### **Explanation of Resources**
1. **`data.aws_iam_policy_document`**:
   - Defines a policy allowing `s3:GetObject` actions on the bucket without any conditions.
   - **Why?** Mostafa and his team are internal users, so there’s no need for IP restrictions.

2. **`aws_iam_policy`**:
   - Converts the policy document into a reusable IAM policy.
   - **Why?** Same reasoning as for Mahmoud; AWS requires policies to be JSON formatted for attachment.

3. **`aws_iam_user_policy_attachment`**:
   - Attaches the custom `GetObject` policy to Mostafa’s user account.
   - **Why?** This allows Mostafa to access the bucket directly using his IAM credentials.

---

### **Why These Resources and Data Blocks Were Used?**
- **Separation of Access Controls**:
  - Ahmed has full administrative access via a managed policy.
  - Mahmoud has a custom policy for external access with IP restrictions.
  - Mostafa has a custom policy for internal access with no restrictions.
  
- **Use of Roles for External Access**:
  - Roles are used for Mahmoud to ensure secure delegation of access.
  
- **Custom vs Managed Policies**:
  - Managed policies (`AmazonS3FullAccess`) are used for Ahmed because they meet the requirement without extra effort.
  - Custom policies are used for Mahmoud and Mostafa to meet specific access requirements (IP restrictions, resource-specific access).

### **Summary Table**
| **User**    | **Resource Type**                | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ahmed       | `aws_iam_user_policy_attachment` | Full S3 access using AWS-managed policy `AmazonS3FullAccess`.              |
| Mahmoud     | `aws_iam_role`                   | Creates a role for external access.                                        |
|             | `data.aws_iam_policy_document`   | Defines a policy with `s3:GetObject` and IP restrictions.                  |
|             | `aws_iam_policy`                 | Converts the policy document into a usable IAM policy.                     |
|             | `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` | Attaches the policy to Mahmoud’s role.                                     |
| Mostafa     | `data.aws_iam_policy_document`   | Defines a policy with `s3:GetObject` without restrictions.                 |
|             | `aws_iam_policy`                 | Converts the policy document into a usable IAM policy.                     |
|             | `aws_iam_user_policy_attachment` | Attaches the policy to Mostafa’s user account.                             |

This approach provides flexibility and adheres to security best practices for managing internal and external access to S3.
